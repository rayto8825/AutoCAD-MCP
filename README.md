![Native AutoCAD 3D rotary actuator generated and rendered by AutoCAD-MCP](docs/assets/autocad-mcp-actuator-promo.png)

AutoCAD-MCP connects Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any standard MCP client to full AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, or a headless DXF backend. It is built for agents that must prove what they drew, not merely report that a script ran.

## Why AutoCAD-MCP

- **Checked writes:** strict inputs, handle readback, requested/actual diffs, and document revisions. Native-worker transactions are atomic; compatibility COM/LISP paths report compensation limits instead of promising rollback they cannot prove.
- **Useful CAD coverage:** structured 2D drawing, layers, dimensions, topology DRC, native AutoCAD solids and booleans, bounded product features, motion screening, and fixed-camera review views.
- **Delivery evidence:** DWG/DXF/PDF/PNG outputs, exported-DXF re-audit, paper and scale verification, geometry digests, manifests, and SHA-256 hashes.
- **Desktop friendly:** AutoCAD stays taskbar-visible but minimized by default, drawing does not steal focus, and preview/PDF viewers are not launched.
- **Client neutral:** one stdio server for MCP clients; no Codex-only or Claude-only protocol.
- **Honest limits:** unsupported edge selection, shelling, exact continuous motion, and material rendering are reported explicitly instead of being simulated.

## Try It Without AutoCAD

The headless demo creates a mechanical DXF, runs semantic DRC, renders a deterministic PNG, and prints the evidence:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/beiming183-cloud/AutoCAD-MCP.git
cd AutoCAD-MCP
uv sync
uv run python examples/headless_demo.py
```

Expected result: `ok: true`, six entities, and `drc_status: PASS`. Outputs are written to `demo-output/` unless `AUTOCAD_MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT` is set.

## Native AutoCAD Showcase

With a healthy, manually opened AutoCAD session, reproduce the promotional
rotary actuator as editable native solids:

```powershell
uv run python examples/generate_actuator_promo.py --record --pause 1.0
```

Recording mode activates AutoCAD once, creates a blank document, frames the
planned model before the first write, pauses one second after each completed
semantic step, and leaves the final document open. It deliberately skips PNG/PDF
rendering and final rotation so no viewer or camera motion interrupts capture.

## Choose a Backend

| Backend | Runtime | Requires AutoCAD? | Validation feedback |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **Native worker** | Windows Python | Full AutoCAD 2025/2026 | Database transactions, revision events, feature IDs, native 2D/3D |
| **File IPC compatibility** | Windows Python | Full AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT 2024+ | COM/LISP coverage, topology audit, PDF and PNG |
| **ezdxf** | Any platform | No (headless) | Structured audit + deterministic PNG |

The server exposes **12 consolidated tools** (`drawing`, `entity`, `solid`, `product`, `layer`, `block`, `annotation`, `pid`, `transaction`, `view`, `job`, `system`) over standard MCP stdio.

This edition is based on [puran-water/autocad-mcp](https://github.com/puran-water/autocad-mcp) and retains its MIT license. Version 4.0 adds a native transactional worker, client-independent named-pipe protocol, external desktop supervisor, durable idempotency journal, and database-owned document revisions while retaining COM/LISP compatibility.

For startup failures caused by a damaged Python COM environment, an orphaned
`acad.exe`, or Activity Insights permissions, use the [Windows AutoCAD recovery
runbook](docs/WINDOWS-AUTOCAD-RECOVERY.md). `system(operation="preflight")` is
read-only and does not start AutoCAD.

## Prerequisites (File IPC backend)

- **Windows 10/11** (the File IPC backend uses Win32 APIs for focus-free window messaging)
- **Full AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT 2024+ on Windows** - AutoLISP support was added to LT in 2024; full AutoCAD also uses the native COM path.
- **Python 3.10+** (Windows native — not WSL Python)
- **uv** package manager ([install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

> The ezdxf headless backend works on any platform (Linux, macOS, WSL) for offline DXF generation without AutoCAD installed.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/beiming183-cloud/AutoCAD-MCP.git
cd AutoCAD-MCP
uv sync
```

### 2. Install the signed native worker (full AutoCAD 2025/2026)

The preferred industrial path is the .NET 8 worker under `native/`. It executes
mutations under `DocumentLock` plus a native database transaction and publishes
a current-user named pipe. Build, Authenticode-sign, verify, and install it with:

```powershell
$env:AUTOCAD_MCP_AUTOCAD_DIR = "D:\cad\AutoCAD 2025"
.\native\scripts\build-plugin.ps1 `
  -AutoCADDir $env:AUTOCAD_MCP_AUTOCAD_DIR `
  -DotNet "D:\Codex\Tools\dotnet-sdk\dotnet.exe" `
  -CertificateThumbprint "YOUR_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_THUMBPRINT" `
  -Install
```

Installation refuses an unsigned DLL. Keep AutoCAD `SECURELOAD` enabled. The
bundle loads at AutoCAD startup and writes its worker descriptor to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCAD-MCP\workers`.

For a stable desktop session, start the user-owned supervisor from an ordinary
PowerShell window, not from an MCP client's sandbox:

```powershell
$env:AUTOCAD_MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT = "D:\Codex\AutoCAD-MCP"
autocad-mcp-supervisor run `
  --acad-exe "D:\cad\AutoCAD 2025\acad.exe" `
  --window-mode quiet_minimized `
  --output-root "D:\Codex\AutoCAD-MCP"
```

The supervisor leaves AutoCAD visible in the taskbar but minimized, never opens
PDF/PNG viewers, and leaves AutoCAD running when supervision stops. Use
`autocad-mcp-supervisor status` from another terminal to inspect PID, HWND,
heartbeat, fatal-window state, and native-worker discovery.

### 3. Load the LISP dispatcher for LT or compatibility fallback

Open AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT and load `mcp_dispatch.lsp` using **APPLOAD**:

1. Type `APPLOAD` in the AutoCAD command line
2. Browse to `<repo>/lisp-code/mcp_dispatch.lsp`
3. Click **Load**
4. You should see: `=== MCP Dispatch v4.0.0 loaded ===` and `Ready for commands via (c:mcp-dispatch)`

> **Tip:** Add the file to your AutoCAD Startup Suite (in the APPLOAD dialog) so it loads automatically with every drawing.

### 4. Configure your MCP client

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g. Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autocad-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\autocad-mcp\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "autocad_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_BACKEND": "file_ipc",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_LISP_PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\autocad-mcp\\lisp-code\\mcp_dispatch.lsp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The same server command can be used in Claude Code project-level `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autocad": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\autocad-mcp\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "autocad_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\path\\to\\autocad-mcp\\src",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_BACKEND": "file_ipc",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_NATIVE_PLUGIN": "auto",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_AUTOSTART": "false",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_VISIBLE": "true",
         "AUTOCAD_MCP_WINDOW_MODE": "preserve",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_ACTIVATE_ON_DRAW": "false",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT": "D:/Codex/AutoCAD-MCP",
        "AUTOCAD_MCP_ACTIVITY_INSIGHTS_PATH": "D:/Codex/AutoCAD-MCP/activity-insights"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key points:**

- The `command` must point to the **Windows Python** inside the project venv (not WSL python).
- `AUTOCAD_MCP_BACKEND` can be `auto` (tries File IPC, then falls back to ezdxf), `file_ipc` (recommended for engineering drawings), or `ezdxf` (headless only).
- Full AutoCAD prefers the native worker. COM/LISP remains a compatibility path; AutoCAD LT uses LISP/window messaging.
- `AUTOCAD_MCP_NATIVE_PLUGIN=required` fails closed when the signed native worker is absent; `auto` falls back to COM/LISP.
- Prefer the desktop supervisor over MCP-owned startup. `AUTOCAD_MCP_AUTOSTART=true` remains available for compatibility.
- When attaching to a CAD instance opened by a user, startup/profile/window policy
  is read-only: it does not rewrite Activity Insights variables or change the
  window unless
  `AUTOCAD_MCP_APPLY_ACTIVITY_POLICY=true` or
  `AUTOCAD_MCP_APPLY_WINDOW_POLICY_TO_EXISTING=true` is explicitly set.

#### Running from WSL

If your MCP client runs in WSL (e.g. Claude Code), launch the server through `cmd.exe` so it runs as a native Windows process:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autocad-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/d", "/s", "/c", "cd /d C:\\path\\to\\autocad-mcp && .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m autocad_mcp"],
      "env": { "AUTOCAD_MCP_BACKEND": "auto" }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Verify

From your MCP client, call:

```
system(operation="status")
```

You should see `backend: "file_ipc"` if AutoCAD is running, or `backend: "ezdxf"` for headless mode.

### Optional industrial design Skill

[`skills/industrial-product-design`](skills/industrial-product-design/SKILL.md) is a client-neutral upstream workflow for briefs, concept gates, product architecture, configurations, motion, camera/render evidence, and honest CAD capability checks. Install or reference that folder in any `SKILL.md`-compatible client, then use `mechanical-drafting-gbt` downstream for GB/T manufacturing definition and release.

[`skills/industrial-product-design-gbt`](skills/industrial-product-design-gbt/SKILL.md) is the comprehensive variant. It adds research-source authority, human-factors evidence, form and surface review, backend routing, local reference-library indexing, and deterministic checks for document identity, 2D/3D interfaces, motion states, render viewsets, and revision-bound handoff manifests. Its personal library manifest is intentionally ignored; generate one locally from the included portable schema.

For architectural, retail/interior, or other multi-system construction drawings, see the agent routing entry [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), the [skills index](skills/README.md), and the [observed construction drawing style](skills/industrial-product-design-gbt/references/ray-construction-drawing-style.md). The same skill includes a [local CAD fine-tuning/LoRA preparation workflow](skills/industrial-product-design-gbt/references/cad-training-preparation.md). Raw drawings, private paths, derived geometry, and training corpora must remain local unless explicitly cleared for publication.

## Tools

### `drawing` — File/drawing management

| Operation | Description | File IPC | ezdxf |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `create` | Create and activate a new document, optionally at a managed path | Yes | Yes |
| `context` | Return active document ID, path, and monotonic revision | Yes | Yes |
| `activate` | Activate a `doc_id` at an exact `expected_revision`, then verify active-document readback | Yes | Limited |

| `redo` | Redo last undone operation | Yes | No |

### `entity` — Entity CRUD + modification

**Create:** `create_line`, `create_circle`, `create_polyline`, `create_rectangle`, `create_arc`, `create_tangent_arc`, `create_ellipse`, `create_mtext`, `create_hatch`, `create_batch`

`create_batch` accepts up to 500 structured entities in one MCP call. It supports line, circle, polyline, rectangle, arc, ellipse, text, mtext, and hatch records. A hatch can use `entity_id: "$last"` to reference the preceding entity. The native worker and headless backend provide atomic batches; the compatibility COM/LISP path uses an AutoCAD undo group and returns rollback evidence, but callers must treat an unverified compensation as a hard stop. This is the preferred high-throughput path; it does not enable arbitrary AutoLISP.

For `ANSI31`, pass `angle: 0` to retain the pattern's native 45-degree section angle. `scale` and hatch `layer` are also explicit parameters. Every HATCH is read back by handle and checked for type, layer, pattern, angle, and scale; a mismatch is erased and returned as `E_POSTCONDITION_MISMATCH`.

**Read:** `list`, `count`, `get`

**Modify:** `copy`, `move`, `rotate`, `scale`, `mirror`, `offset`\*, `array`, `fillet`\*, `chamfer`\*, `trim`\*, `extend`\*, `break`\*, `join`\*, `constrain`\*, `erase`

> \* These native editing operations are File IPC only. `trim` and `extend` require explicit entity IDs and pick points so AutoCAD never guesses which side to keep.

`constrain` reports whether the native command was accepted, but currently returns `verified: false` because the portable ActiveX API does not expose AutoCAD's associative constraint collection. Treat the constraint as review-required rather than release evidence.

### `solid` - Native AutoCAD 3D solids

`create_box`, `create_cylinder`, `extrude`, `revolve`, `sweep`, `boolean`

The `solid` tool is available on full AutoCAD through the native ActiveX object model. Box placement uses its center; cylinder placement uses the center of its base. Extrude, revolve, and sweep consume a closed profile handle; boolean accepts `union`, `intersection`, or `subtract`. AutoCAD LT and the ezdxf backend report these operations as unsupported. Edge fillets/chamfers and projected drawing views are not advertised yet because their prompt-driven workflows have not reached the same deterministic standard.

`system.status` includes an `industrial_capabilities` matrix. It explicitly separates verified features from unavailable stable edge/face selection, shelling, parametric assemblies, motion sweeps, surface analysis, and offscreen material rendering. Clients must not infer those features from basic solid support.

### `product` - Industrial product features and evidence

`create_feature` supports `rounded_box`, `recessed_panel`, `module_reservation`, `port_cutout_usb_a`, `port_cutout_usb_c`, `rotary_layer`, `annular_gap`, and `detent_ring_placeholder`. The rounded box is a real analytic AutoCAD B-rep assembled from intersecting boxes, edge cylinders, and spherical corners; its radius can be queried from the registered feature definition.

USB cutouts are deliberately gated. A production aperture requires `module_status: supplier_controlled|measured`, matching `authority: supplier_drawing|physical_measurement`, `do_not_dimension_apertures: false`, explicit dimensions, and a target solid. Unverified concepts must use `module_reservation`, which records that the envelope is not manufacturing authority.

Motion operations are `set_motion`, `interference_sample`, and `clearance_sweep`. They report broad-phase AABB or sampled rotated-AABB evidence and always state `exact_brep_interference: false`; release work still requires an exact native continuous sweep.

`render_view` accepts `front`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `iso`, `rotated_iso`, `section`, and `exploded`. Section/exploded views require caller-prepared geometry. The result includes fixed camera data, PNG hash, content bounds, non-background ratio, clipping, framing status, and optional pixel difference. Pass an allow-listed `visual_style` to request an AutoCAD display style; the response separately reports style readback, restoration verification, and `material_render_verified` (currently false for the compatibility plot path). This remains a native AutoCAD plot, not an offscreen material renderer.

`set_review` and `review_summary` keep `appearance_review`, `ergonomics_review`, `adapter_clearance_review`, `cable_management_review`, `stability_review`, and `mains_rotation_safety_review` separate from geometry/STEP validity. Each is `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `NOT_EVALUATED`; `PASS` requires evidence.

General `fillet_edges` and `chamfer_edges` reject volatile native edge indices with `E_STABLE_FEATURE_SELECTION_UNAVAILABLE`. Use analytic features now. A future OpenCascade/FreeCAD plugin may provide selector-based general edge operations without weakening the AutoCAD document and transaction contract.

On the COM/LISP compatibility backend, destructive product replacements
(`recessed_panel`, `port_cutout_usb_a`, and `port_cutout_usb_c`) fail closed with
`E_COMPAT_FEATURE_TRANSACTION_UNAVAILABLE` because ActiveX cannot prove an
atomic replacement. Use the signed native worker; the unsafe compatibility
fallback requires an explicit `AUTOCAD_MCP_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_COMPAT_CUTOUTS=true`
and is unsuitable for release work.

The 3D protocol borrows proven patterns from [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), [build123d-mcp](https://pypi.org/project/build123d-mcp/), [FreeCAD MCP](https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp), and [Open CASCADE fillet/chamfer APIs](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/package_b_repfilletapi.html): explicit parameter sources, semantic/property selectors, measure-render-validate loops, and honest kernel capability boundaries.

### `layer` — Layer management

`list`, `create`, `set_current`, `set_properties`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `lock`, `unlock`

### `block` — Block operations

| Operation | File IPC | ezdxf |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `list` | Yes | Yes |
| `insert` | Yes | Yes |
| `insert_with_attributes` | Yes | Yes |
| `get_attributes` | Yes | Yes |
| `update_attribute` | Yes | Yes |
| `define` | No | Yes |

### `annotation` — Text, dimensions, leaders

`create_text`, `create_dimension_linear`, `create_dimension_aligned`, `create_dimension_angular`, `create_dimension_radius`, `create_leader`

### `pid` — P&ID operations (CTO symbol library)

`setup_layers`, `insert_symbol`, `list_symbols`, `draw_process_line`, `connect_equipment`, `add_flow_arrow`, `add_equipment_tag`, `add_line_number`, `insert_valve`, `insert_instrument`, `insert_pump`, `insert_tank`

> P&ID symbol insertion requires the [CAD Tools Online](https://www.cadtoolsonline.com/) (CTO) P&ID Symbol Library installed at `C:\PIDv4-CTO\`. The ezdxf backend has built-in CTO library support. For the File IPC backend, some P&ID operations require additional LISP helpers — see the P&ID section in the wiki for setup details.

### `view` — Viewport and diagnostic capture

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `zoom_extents` | Zoom to show all entities |
| `zoom_window` | Zoom to a specified window |
| `set_visual_style` | Apply an allowlisted built-in style (Conceptual, Realistic, Shaded, etc.) with optional verified entity colors; requires `doc_id` and `expected_revision` |
| `get_screenshot` | Diagnostic-only capture; returns a managed PNG path, dimensions, and SHA-256 by default. Raw image content requires `data.include_image=true` plus `AUTOCAD_MCP_ALLOW_INLINE_IMAGES=true`. |

Normal validation is data-first: use `drawing.audit` after edits and `drawing.render_preview` at milestones. `get_screenshot` remains available only for diagnosing AutoCAD UI state. The MCP serializes AutoCAD calls and caps response/call bursts so a parallel screenshot loop cannot exhaust the client context.

### `transaction` - Document-scoped transactions

`context`, `create`, `execute`, plus compatibility `begin`, `commit`, `rollback`

For the native path, call `context`, then send one strict `execute` request with a
stable `idempotency_key`. The plugin validates the active document and revision,
opens one database transaction, rejects missing layers before creation, and
commits all operations or none. A document mismatch returns
`E_DOCUMENT_ID_MISMATCH`; stale revision data returns
`E_DOCUMENT_REVISION_MISMATCH`. Successful idempotent requests can be replayed;
failed requests are not cached and remain retryable.

```json
{
  "operation": "execute",
  "doc_id": "acad-...",
  "expected_revision": 12,
  "idempotency_key": "gearbox-stage-01",
  "data": {
    "session_id": "native-...",
    "operations": [
      {
        "type": "solid.box",
        "resultId": "body",
        "featureId": "gearbox-body",
        "center": [0, 0, 20],
        "length": 120,
        "width": 80,
        "height": 40,
        "layer": "0"
      },
      {
        "type": "solid.cylinder",
        "resultId": "bore",
        "baseCenter": [0, 0, -1],
        "radius": 12,
        "height": 42,
        "layer": "0"
      },
      {
        "type": "solid.boolean",
        "resultId": "finished",
        "primaryRef": "body",
        "toolRef": "bore",
        "operation": "subtract",
        "layer": "0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The older `begin`/`commit`/`rollback` operations remain for AutoCAD LT and
compatibility workflows. They use undo marks and do not replace the native
database transaction when the plugin is available.

Layer names are preconditions. Creating geometry on an absent layer returns `E_LAYER_NOT_FOUND` before mutation instead of silently falling back to layer `0`.

### Data-first validation

```text
edit entities -> drawing.audit -> native render_preview -> audit_dxf for final delivery
```

`drawing.audit` returns entity counts by type and layer, drawing bounds, units, a handle-independent geometry digest, geometry DRC, an endpoint topology graph, limited normalized entity geometry, and added/modified/removed handles since the previous audit. In addition to degenerate geometry, rules can check connection gaps, dangling endpoints, interior crossings, explicit tangent pairs, equal-radius groups, and cross-view projection alignment. `limit` is clamped to 500 so large drawings do not flood model context.

`drawing.render_preview` always returns a real PNG. Full AutoCAD writes it through the native PNG plot device without capturing the desktop or opening a viewer. The result includes DPI, pixel size, orientation correction, SHA-256, and the source geometry digest. Add `visual_style` to request a controlled display style; the response reports actual style restoration and whether material rendering was independently verified. `drawing.plot_pdf` remains the release-quality vector output.

### Industrial delivery jobs

`drawing.deliver` turns the active drawing into a traceable job rather than treating a successful script as a finished drawing. It creates an isolated folder under `jobs`, records the request under `specs`, audits the source, applies geometry gates, saves DWG/DXF/PDF, audits the exported DXF, compares type/layer counts, bounds, units and geometry digests, writes `reports/validation.json`, and records artifact sizes and SHA-256 hashes.

```json
{
  "operation": "deliver",
  "data": {
    "name": "gearbox-output-shaft",
    "metadata": {"drawing_number": "GB-OS-001", "revision": "A"},
    "plot": {
      "paper": "A3",
      "orientation": "landscape",
      "plot_style": "monochrome.ctb",
      "scale_mode": "fixed",
      "scale": "1:1",
      "center": true
    },
    "validation": {
      "min_entities": 20,
      "required_layers": ["OUTLINE", "CENTER", "DIM"],
      "required_types": ["LINE", "CIRCLE", "DIMENSION"],
      "require_geometry_clean": true,
      "geometry_tolerance": 0.000001
    }
  }
}
```

The job contains `specs/request.json`, `manifest.json`, editable DWG and DXF files, a native PDF, `audits/drawing-audit.json`, and `reports/validation.json`. Failed validation or export leaves a failed manifest with step-level diagnostics.

### Industrial automation roadmap

- **v3.6 reliability (compatibility foundation):** self-healing startup, dispatcher version handshake, machine-readable MCP failures, controlled variables, geometry DRC, DXF units/digests, and enforced plot configuration; live AutoCAD profile repairs remain opt-in.
- **v3.7 geometry control (compatibility foundation):** topology DRC, bounded batches, safe trim/extend/break/join/constraints, native 3D solids, non-switching DXF export, and verified file/framing checks; COM rollback remains explicitly bounded.
- **v3.8 entity truth (implemented with gates):** immutable entity contracts, semantic topology, no-focus desktop behavior, and postcondition readback; unresolved context failures are terminal and require reconciliation.
- **v3.9 document/output reliability (implemented with gates):** document identity, transactions, crash classification, offline audits, atomic outputs, plot verification, and viewer suppression; exact guarantees require the native worker.
- **v3.10 product 3D foundation (concept/engineering candidate):** analytic rounded products, controlled module envelopes, broad-phase motion screening, fixed-camera evidence, semantic DRC, and independent product reviews; exact assemblies, material rendering, and continuous sweeps remain unsupported.
- **v4.0 hybrid CAD:** FreeCAD CLI/MCP as the parameterized 3D and STEP executor, AutoCAD as the visible DWG/2D drafting and release executor, with shared specs and acceptance reports.

### `system` — Server management

`status`, `ensure_ready`, `health`, `get_backend`, `runtime`, `init`, `recover`, `execute_lisp`

`status` is observational and does not start AutoCAD. `ensure_ready` performs the full discovery/start/document/dispatcher/version/ping sequence and reports the detected AutoCAD product without assuming AutoCAD LT.

Tool failures use MCP `isError=true` and a stable structure containing `code`, `message`, `recoverable`, and `recommended_action`.

`recover` cancels stale AutoCAD command-line state and removes abandoned IPC files without calling the potentially blocked dispatcher. Arbitrary AutoLISP remains disabled unless `AUTOCAD_MCP_ALLOW_ARBITRARY_LISP=true` is explicitly configured.

> `execute_lisp` is an explicit opt-in escape hatch for trusted local use. Normal automation should use the structured tools and `create_batch`.

## Architecture

```
MCP Client (Codex / Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor)
    │  stdio (JSON-RPC)
    ▼
Python MCP Server (autocad_mcp)
    │
    ├── File IPC Backend ──► C:/temp/*.json ──► mcp_dispatch.lsp
    │   ├── Full AutoCAD: COM ActiveDocument.SendCommand
    │   └── AutoCAD LT: PostMessageW(WM_CHAR) to MDIClient
    │
    └── ezdxf Backend ──► in-memory DXF (headless, no AutoCAD needed)
```

The File IPC backend sends `(c:mcp-dispatch)` to the active drawing. Full AutoCAD uses COM `ActiveDocument.SendCommand`; AutoCAD LT falls back to `PostMessageW(WM_CHAR)`. Both paths avoid taking over normal mouse input.

## Environment Variables

| `AUTOCAD_MCP_CAMPAIGN_TIMEOUT` | `900` | Hard timeout for the complete live-CAD regression campaign (30-3600) |

The managed regression runners are deliberately fail-closed. A timed-out COM
call quarantines its STA worker (`E_COM_STA_TIMEOUT`) and refuses follow-up
requests until the MCP worker is restarted; a timed-out pytest slice attempts
to terminate its complete process tree and records any cleanup limitation.
This prevents a stalled AutoCAD/COM process from holding an MCP client turn
indefinitely.

> `mcp_dispatch.lsp` reads `AUTOCAD_MCP_IPC_DIR` from the AutoCAD process environment and falls back to `C:/temp`.

`drawing.audit_dxf` is an offline operation and does not start AutoCAD, require an active document, or ping the dispatcher. `drawing.plot_pdf` defaults to `A3`, `landscape`, and `FIT`; the result includes requested settings, actual document/output paths, PDF mediabox dimensions, detected paper/orientation, and field-level differences.

## AutoCAD LT AutoLISP Compatibility

AutoLISP was added to AutoCAD LT in the **2024 release (Windows only)**. AutoCAD LT for Mac does not support AutoLISP.

| Supported (LT 2024+ Windows) | Not Supported |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `.lsp` / `.fas` / `.vlx` / `.dcl` | VLIDE (Visual LISP IDE) |
| All `vl-*` utility functions | `vlax-*` (ActiveX/COM) |
| File I/O (`open`, `read-line`, etc.) | Express Tools |
| Entity access (`entget`, `entmod`, etc.) | 3D operations |
| Selection sets | AutoLISP on Mac |

The `mcp_dispatch.lsp` dispatcher is fully compatible with LT 2024+.

## What's New in v4.0

- **Native transaction worker** - current-user named pipes connect standard MCP clients to a .NET worker using `DocumentLock`, database transactions, database-event revisions, and stable XData feature IDs.
- **Fail-closed document fencing** - native writes require session, document ID, expected revision, and a stable idempotency key; active-document mismatch or stale revision prevents all mutation.
- **Durable replay safety** - Python journals accepted/committed/failed jobs; the plugin caches only committed successes and hashes semantic requests without transport IDs or credentials.
- **Desktop supervisor** - a user-owned process manages PID/HWND/profile health while keeping AutoCAD taskbar-visible, minimized, focus-safe, and independent of Codex, Claude Code, or another client's sandbox.
- **Signed bundle flow** - source builds can Authenticode-sign, verify, and install the AutoCAD bundle without disabling `SECURELOAD`.
- **Managed test cleanup** - CAD artifacts are deleted only inside a confirmed job directory while hashes, manifests, audits, reports, and logs remain.

### v3.10

- **Analytic native rounded products** - `rounded_box` creates real radius geometry without relying on volatile native edge indices.
- **Controlled module authority** - concept, supplier-controlled, and measured modules carry explicit dimension authority; unverified USB apertures are rejected.
- **Motion evidence** - rotation axes, limits, static AABB screening, and sampled rotated-AABB clearance sweeps are machine-readable and explicitly non-exact.
- **Fixed-camera review packets** - standard views return camera parameters, PNG hashes, content bounds, margins, clipping, framing status, and optional pixel differences.
- **Semantic DRC** - component, design role, view, line class, intentional open end, permitted crossing, and source authority keep overlays out of geometry failures.
- **Independent product review** - appearance, ergonomics, adapter clearance, cable management, stability, and mains/rotation safety cannot inherit a PASS from valid geometry.
- **Honest edge capability** - general 3D fillet/chamfer calls return `E_STABLE_FEATURE_SELECTION_UNAVAILABLE`; analytic features remain measurable and safe.

### v3.9

- **Document identity and optimistic revisions** - create/open/activate/context responses carry document ID, requested/active paths, and monotonic revision; all modifications reject wrong or stale contexts.
- **Public transactions** - explicit begin/commit/rollback joins atomic batch rollback and missing-layer preconditions.
- **Crash and system error classification** - fatal AutoCAD state, COM failures, file paths, system calls, errno/winerror, and recovery actions use structured error envelopes.
- **Read-only delivery copies** - DWG packaging uses `Wblock` and verifies the active source document and path did not change.
- **Offline DXF audits** - DXF parsing does not start AutoCAD or require a dispatcher or active document.
- **Atomic outputs** - PDF and PNG publish through validated temporary files; locked destinations return `E_OUTPUT_LOCKED` without half-written artifacts.
- **Verified paper and orientation** - A3 landscape FIT is the PDF default, mediabox settings are read back, and device-rotated PNG output is normalized.
- **No viewer focus theft** - a per-output window guard hides and closes only the exact temporary PDF opened by an external viewer, restores the last non-AutoCAD user window, and records suppression evidence.
- **Cold-start stability gate** - AutoCAD must return the same active document through consecutive COM reads; dispatcher loading is retried within a fixed bound before readiness is reported.
- **Honest industrial capability reporting** - status exposes verified features and names advanced 3D, assembly, analysis, selection, and rendering functions that remain unsupported.

### v3.8

- **Immutable entity contracts** - strict requests are read back by handle with `requested`, `actual`, and `diff`; mismatches are deleted and fail the atomic batch.
- **Semantic topology** - component ownership, line class, and intentional open ends feed stricter dangling-endpoint and crossing audits.
- **No-focus desktop behavior** - AutoCAD remains user-visible in the taskbar but minimized by default, drawing calls do not steal focus, and PDF/PNG viewers are never launched.

### v3.7

- **Topology-aware DRC** - audits expose endpoint connectivity and configurable checks for near misses, dangling endpoints, non-endpoint crossings, tangency, equal-radius groups, and projection alignment.
- **Atomic batches** - `create_batch` opens an AutoCAD undo transaction by default and rolls back the whole batch on failure.
- **Controlled 2D repair** - explicit `trim`, `extend`, `break`, `join`, geometric constraints, and mathematically solved tangent arcs replace blind coordinate patching.
- **Native 3D solids** - full AutoCAD supports boxes, cylinders, extrusions, revolutions, sweeps, and boolean operations through a dedicated safe tool.
- **True PNG previews** - native AutoCAD plotting is rasterized to a force-overwritable white-background PNG with DPI, dimensions, hashes, and no desktop capture.
- **Non-switching DXF export** - `save_as_dxf` uses AutoCAD's export API and verifies that the active DWG remains unchanged.
- **Richer entity data** - arc endpoints, polyline bulges, MText width/attachment, block attributes, bounds, length, area, and object ownership are returned when available.

### v3.6

- **Self-healing readiness** - `system.ensure_ready` discovers or starts AutoCAD, ensures an active document, loads the configured or bundled dispatcher, verifies its version, and pings IPC.
- **Structured MCP errors** - failures are marked `isError=true` and use stable error codes such as `E_DISPATCHER_NOT_LOADED`, `E_IPC_TIMEOUT`, and `E_OUTPUT_PATH_REJECTED`.
- **Safe variable updates** - `drawing.set_variables` exposes a validated whitelist; `setup_mechanical` now applies millimeter and dimension defaults in addition to layers.
- **Geometry DRC** - source and exported DXF audits detect zero/short segments, duplicate vertices/endpoints/entities, and polyline self-intersections.
- **Stronger DXF evidence** - audits report `$INSUNITS` and a handle-independent geometry digest; delivery compares types, layers, bounds, units, digest, and DRC.
- **Enforced plotting** - `plot_pdf` and `deliver` apply and record paper, orientation, plot style, fixed/fit scale, centering, device, media, and paper units.

### v3.5

- **Unified managed workspace** - output paths default to the portable `~/Documents/AutoCAD-MCP`; each client can override it with `AUTOCAD_MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT` (for example `D:/CAD-Automation`).
- **Output containment** - save/export paths outside the managed root are redirected unless external outputs are explicitly enabled.
- **Validated delivery jobs** - `drawing.deliver` produces DWG, DXF, PDF, request/audit JSON, a step manifest, validation results, file sizes, and SHA-256 checksums.
- **Quality gates** - delivery can require minimum/maximum entity counts plus required layers and entity types, and rejects DXF exports whose entity count differs from the source.

### v3.4

- **Prompt-free layer management** - common center and hidden linetypes are created or loaded without opening an interactive linetype prompt.
- **Mechanical drafting profile** - `drawing.setup_mechanical` creates `OUTLINE`, `THIN`, `CENTER`, `HIDDEN`, `HATCH`, `DIM`, and `TEXT` with monochrome GB/T lineweights.
- **Structured batch creation** - up to 500 whitelisted entities can be submitted in one MCP call without enabling arbitrary AutoLISP.
- **Portable Chinese text** - File IPC converts non-ASCII annotation text to AutoCAD `\\U+XXXX` escapes.
- **Reliable hatching** - pattern angle and scale are explicit; `ANSI31` defaults to an added angle of zero.
- **Out-of-band recovery** - `system.recover` cancels stuck commands and cleans IPC state without waiting for the dispatcher.
- **Native save path** - full AutoCAD saves DWG/DXF through COM first and uses the AutoLISP command path only as a fallback.
- **Automation-session discovery** - hidden AutoCAD instances can be found through their COM window handle when no visible main window is available.
- **TEXT audit fix** - final DXF audits read `TEXT` and `MTEXT` heights through their correct entity-specific attributes.
- **Live visible drawing** - AutoCAD is restored before drawing by default; optional foreground activation and `view.show_window` make automation observable in real time.
- **Startup busy retry** - transient COM call rejection during AutoCAD startup is retried briefly before the Win32 fallback is used.
- **Idle-state synchronization** - each IPC request waits for AutoCAD to finish unwinding the previous dispatcher before sending the next command.
- **Verified entity creation** - rectangles, hatches, and dimensions report an error when no new CAD entity was actually created.
- **Native COM dimensions** - full AutoCAD creates linear, aligned, angular, and radial dimensions directly through ActiveX, with AutoLISP retained as the LT fallback.
- **Automatic centered view** - geometry changes automatically fit all extents into the viewport; structured batches fit once after completion, and `view.fit_drawing` can trigger it manually.

### v3.3

- **Structured drawing audits** - compact counts, layers, bounds, normalized geometry, and change fingerprints.
- **Native preview rendering** - full AutoCAD plots PDF through `PlotToFile`; ezdxf writes deterministic PNG.
- **DXF mathematical audit** - parses existing DXF files into bounded normalized JSON instead of returning raw DXF text.
- **Data-first defaults** - automatic screenshot feedback is disabled by default; window capture is diagnostic only.
- **Richer AutoLISP entity details** - arcs, polylines, text, blocks, and dimensions report useful geometry.

### v3.2

- **Full AutoCAD COM transport** - sends command expressions through `ActiveDocument.SendCommand`.
- **Process-based window detection** - recognizes localized titles and the AutoCAD Start page by verifying `acad.exe`.
- **Optional AutoCAD startup** - launches a configured `acad.exe` and waits for its window.
- **Session-scoped dispatcher loading** - loads a configured LISP dispatcher without changing persistent trust paths.

### v3.1

- **`execute_lisp`** — Run arbitrary AutoLISP code via temp file pattern. Turns the server from a fixed command set into an extensible automation platform.
- **Undo / Redo** — Single-step undo and redo via `drawing` tool.
- **Drawing open** — Open existing `.dwg` files programmatically (FILEDIA suppressed).
- **Drawing create** — Now resets current drawing (erase all + purge) instead of `_.NEW`, preserving the LISP dispatcher namespace.
- **Drawing save with path** — `save` with a `path` parameter uses SAVEAS; without path uses QSAVE.
- **`get_variables` fix** — Respects the `names` parameter; returns requested variables with proper type handling.
- **Polyline/leader fix** — Point arrays properly encoded via semicolon-delimited format.
- **ESC prefix** — Sends 2x ESC before each dispatch to cancel stale pending commands from prior timeouts.
- **UTF-8/cp1252 fallback** — Handles non-ASCII characters in LISP result files (AutoCAD writes Windows-1252).
- **Configurable IPC timeout** — `AUTOCAD_MCP_IPC_TIMEOUT` env var (1–300 seconds, default 10).
- **Thread-safe backend init** — `asyncio.Lock` prevents parallel initialization races.
